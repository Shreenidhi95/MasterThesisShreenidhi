# Thesis Abstract

The success of project depends on compliance to requirements amongst other things.This forms Requirements Management process,  an important step in the SystemsEngineering  life  cycle.   However,  poor  definition  of  requirements  is  an  obstaclein  automating  verification  process.    The  existing  solutions  based  on  various  ap-proaches focuses predominantly on building codes requirement verification and isnot  suitable  for  dynamicity  of  the  client  specific  requirements.   Existing  solutionsalso  requires  users  to  have  expertise  on  programming  and  construction  domainknowledge.  Hence,  a general approach for rewriting client requirements in a ma-chine understandable way is needed.  The research proposes this general approachusing standard libraries such as object type libraries (OTL)s.
